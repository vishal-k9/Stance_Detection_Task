Every year I see ads & think 'that sounds great!' Stop tricking me into thinking you want sth positive!
Why would I defend something that kills people? Remember killed by Irish "#prolife" laws?
Of course an embryo is a person! If it were a puppy there'd be no desire to abort it.
If it's not a person then why do women get invitro? To have a gold fish?
There should be no law or funding which justifies the murder of innocent life.
In 1776 we killed the conservatives, freed ourselves from that crap
Compromising on gets easier as time goes on. Oh yeah, it didn't just start!
AntiChoice laws say women can't make their own decisions

The most horrific violence in America is the war on babies.
If the Pope gave a flying fuck about the poor on his home continent, he'd let them have abortion and birth control.

if truth is a micro aggression 2 the left Why is name calling by the left not a mega hypocrisy?
If is good enough for your it should be good enough for you.
Hi @HillaryClinton while you are campaigning, 3000 innocent lives were killed by your pals
Why are Tumblr feminists so territorial? Pro-lifers can't even voice their opinions without being attacked.
The sanctity of human life is not a woman's issue.
@denisemourges @RepThomasMassie I know! I'm the only perfect :-) candidate.
Next time just keep the baby
People don't care about things that don't effect men which is the same reason it's sexist we don't cover birth control
The point is BODILY AUTONOMY. A born child can rely on other people, and can LIVE by itself
@ConnectCatholic The justification of abortion is rooted in selfishness & fear & they come from lack of faith & self centeredness
Abortionists and their supporters are the REAL misogynists!
Some babies die by chance, none should die by choice!
@BaronTrader @DynaMoChen Margret Sangers Looking a little rough!!!!
I would never expect an 11 year old girl to have to carry a pregnancy to term
Monk's Hobbit is back in Twitter.
@BuresLynn @sallykohn @CoFemale Kohn is also anti-human rights, anti-social justice, anti-peace, pro-violence.

@ProWomanChoice @laurawrpie @JaxLeSigh both r 1e u abuse with misinformation (#women) n d other u kill by
@BuhayIpaglaban @laurawrpie @JaxLeSigh Like I said I'm glad this medical procedure is around so that pregnant people stay healthy.
@BuhayIpaglaban @laurawrpie Every time I "discuss" with "#prolife" it reaffirms my belief that are complete idiots.
Yes. Antis just don't make sense.
Women ARE capable of making decisions
@laurawrpie @ProWomanChoice d real question is. do u even research d side effects of abortion and contraceptives?
@paradiselost_17 @ArguDaz @Brainman365 @PolarVan @yetigcreature Yes, an occasional hypocrite. I support & abhor
Oh you dont like that Im Pro-choice. Pftt. Dont try to force me to be pro-life. Fuck off
Watch out for censorship in your news and media!
Not sure where I stand on God and religion. Still, don't need to be a Christian or religious to be against abortion.
NEVER try to police men over sex, but punishing women puts them into a frenzy.
To run outside? To run inside?
Anti choice laws only effect women. People don't care about things that don't effect men
People with a uterus can be pro choice. People who have been pregnant can be pro choice. People who lost a child can be prochoice
You can't give the "death penalty" to something not living sentient or autonomous
@knowj @kalenjordan @benmarks @MageTalk not ashamed to say it's me. I'm not in favor of enc itself as not banning enc modules.
@ShowTruth if they made it illegal, people would use coat hangers, and your photos would really be messed up.
Abortion is genocide - I don't think you know what genocide means.
Yea, let's make a woman suffer 18 years and raise a child with an unfit parent who hates it because of "morality".
Pro-life laws only effect women so anti choicers are fine with these laws because the laws are only hurting are females
Anti-choice laws are entirely men controlling women
A fetus is not living, breathing, born, sentient, or autonomous which is why the pregnant woman's choice matters more
What about in cases of rape
Only one can have bodily autonomy
Antis don't care because the only people the laws are hurting are females and they don't care about things that don't effect men
Like 96% of antis don't care about breathing viable persons, and 100% care about embryos more
Anti choice laws are sexist because they ignore the fact that men abandon their pregnant partners & those men face no punishment
This is the same reason it's sexist that we don't cover women's birth control. Any issue that primarily effects women is ignored

@SenSchumer You sponsored the religious freedom bill. What is this bill that allows killing full term babies in NY?

@NBCLA isn't opposed merely b/c it's against God's will (as if we're neanderthals). It's murder. Like
Pro-Choice=Pro-Life. Anti-Choice=Anti-Life. Don't play righteous when you're advocating the endangerment of women.
It is not Pro-Life if you ignore life of the pregnant woman; that includes physical/mental health.IsProLife
@marcmaron @amyschumer @JuddApatow Are you a triceratops or tricerabottom?
@paigeymadisonn: 12. something you hate. People who don't believe abortion should be kept safe and sterile.
Would you rather have women taking dangerous concoctions to induce abortions or know they are getting a safe & legal one?
@Cody_Fulk92 @ntfem @brettzawesome Actually, child-murder is far worse these days. We live in more savage times.
